"""
The splash: what pptmstr is, the glitching quote, a hint and the raster-swept art.

Nothing calls ``draw`` today. NEEDS YOU drew it on an empty fleet until the operator
switched the cold-start splash off (planning/2026-10-15-ui-rework.md, "The cold-start
splash is switched off"), and asked that the drawing be kept for an About dialog.
It is kept whole here, so a caller that begins a window and calls ``draw(now)``
gets what NEEDS YOU drew, pinned by tests/test_inbox_splash.py,
tests/test_splash_quote.py and the luminance band in tests/test_theme.py.

The pure parts -- the quote's glitch, the art's sweep and the fitting arithmetic --
are ``splash``; the art and its ranking are ``splash_art``. This module is only
their drawing.

# collapse toward each other -- would otherwise have nothing marking this line as an
# instruction. The accent makes it findable; the literal "Ctrl+N" is what makes it

# Module-level, which departs from ``splash.ArtFrames``' own advice to let the pane own
# it: ``draw`` is a function of the frame's clock and is handed no presentation state.
# A caller that holds state of its own (an About dialog) could hold one instead.
#
# The deviation is affordable because there is nothing here to invalidate: the key is
# the step index, the art and the ranking are module constants, and colour is applied
# at draw time rather than baked into the memo -- so a theme switch cannot make an
# entry stale and a teardown leaks one tuple of 61 strings.
#
# What it buys, measured rather than estimated: ``time.perf_counter`` either side of
# ``splash.art_frame``, once per step across one whole 81-step cycle, gives 0.55ms mean
# and 0.99ms worst against 0.0002ms for a memo hit (2000 hits, same clock, one machine).
# The step rate is 16/s while a window being dragged is awake at 60, so 44 of every 60
# frames ask for a picture that has not changed -- about 24ms a second of re-derivation
# the render thread does not do, roughly 4% of the frame budget.
_ART_FRAMES = splash.ArtFrames()

# The three luminance levels, as named palette entries.
#
# The obvious triple -- text_dim, text, text_strong -- must not ship. ``text`` and
# ``text_strong`` are the same bytes on high_contrast and on win311, so the line and the
# row behind it would be one flat bar there; and on cde (1.08:1) and turbo (1.07:1) the
# two separate in hue alone, which theme.py's first rule forbids as a sole channel.
#
# So TRAIL is RASTER's own ink at one step of ``theme.faded``, and the step is forced
# from both sides of faded's twelve-step grid. Step 9 collapses TRAIL into DIM on
# high_contrast -- white at 191/255 over black is #BFBFBF against text_dim's #C0C0C0,
# 1.01:1 -- and step 11 drops TRAIL to within 1.19:1 of RASTER on dark. Step 10 is the
# step that maximises the *smaller* of the two separations, which is the quantity that
# matters, because either one collapsing costs the same thing: a one-row band.
#
# And that is why the triple is pinned next door rather than here.
# ``splash.RASTER_ROWS_PER_SECOND`` is 16 only because the luminance band is two rows,
# and the band is two rows only where TRAIL is seen as part of the line instead of as
# more background. splash.py cannot check that -- it emits an ordinal and imports no
# palette by design -- so its rate constant is an assertion about the three lines below,
# and tests/test_theme.py holds it over all nine palettes.

    corrupted characters; the prose carries the block's extent, which must not move when
    a character is corrupted. Drawing the prose would produce a correct, still quote with
    no glitch in it, and measuring the glyphs would tie the space claimed below to an
    animation.

    Through the draw list rather than as a chain of ``text_colored``/``same_line``

    colour and memoises it, so a per-character tint is a dict hit rather than the
    per-frame colour arithmetic theme.py's header rules out of panels; and a hundred
    characters as a hundred layout items would put a hundred entries in this window's
    ID stack every frame to draw two lines of prose.

    The art, centred, at the largest size the remaining region allows, a colour a row.

    Returns without drawing when it does not fit. ``fit_size`` clamps up to its floor
    rather than reporting failure, so the answer still has to be checked against the
    room -- a clipped half-silhouette reads as a rendering fault, where nothing reads
    as deliberate.

    Through the draw list, which ``_quote`` also does but for a different reason. Here
    it is the only way to get a colour per row: the whole picture as one text item takes
    one pushed style colour, and one ``text()`` per row would insert
    ``style.item_spacing.y`` between rows and stand the art 60 spacings taller than
    ``required_extent`` just promised the pane it would be. Placing the rows by hand
    moves the pitch onto ``splash.LINE_PITCH_EM``, the constant ``fit_size`` and
    ``required_extent`` are already written against, so the three cannot disagree about
    where row 60 is. ImGui's own multi-line block advances by exactly that same pitch --
    ``calc_text_size`` on the 61-row art returns 61.0000 x size at every even size in
    the clamp range, measured in a live frame -- so this is a reimplementation of what
    the one call was already doing, not a new geometry.

    A row is one ``add_text``, not one per cell as in ``_quote``. ImGui emits no
    vertices for a glyph with no visible rect, so the art's spaces cost nothing to pass
    through and 61 calls draw what 4392 would. Nothing on this route is a printf path,
    so the '%' in the art needs no guarding here.
